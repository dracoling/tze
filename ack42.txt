And I'm here again! 2009.04.15.0213

Welcome to the ack!mud 4.2 release!  Several bugs were fixed from 4.1, and
some additions to the code:

added in imc 0.9, the latest release version of imc.
  before you reboot, make sure that you cd to /area/imc, and mv config to
config.bak.  write down your hub information ( passwords, etc. ) before
rebooting.
  when you get back up, do the following:

  imc localname <your imc identifier>
  imc localport <your imc port that the hub uses>
  imc add hub <or whichever hub you connect to>
  imc set hub all <your info here>
  rconnect hub

  that should do it :)
  
other changes:

  all previously posted bug fixes for 4.1
  better boot error code, with messages pointing to the correct files.
  some new imm commands, including deny, log, and transfer on players not
  logged in.
